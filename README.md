Shortcut Maps
========

Shortcut Maps is a javascript project that helps application owners build an embeddable widget that shows a keyboard and a list of possible commands and their keyboard shortcuts.  Simply supply a JSON file that contains all of the commands and their respective key sequences then run the build tool.  The output will be a script file you'll include on your site.  Add the resource and create a container with an id of "keyboard-shortcuts-container" and voila!
